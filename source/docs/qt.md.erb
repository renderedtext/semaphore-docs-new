Semaphore supports the following versions of the Qt runtime:

<% package_versions("qt").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Switching between Qt versions is done through creating an environment variable
called `QT_SELECT`.

The value of this variable can be set to:

  - `5` or `qt5` to select version <%= package_versions("qt").last %>
  - `4` or `qt4` to select version <%= package_versions("qt").first %>

The default version is <%= package_versions("qt").first %>.

The environment variable user-interface may not work in setting this variable. 
Instead, use a build command: `export QT_SELECT=5`

If you use the `capybara-webkit` gem and decide to change the version of Qt, the
gem has to be reinstalled. One way to achieve this, is by expiring your project's
cache in Project Settings (you must be the project owner to expire the cache). 
On the other hand, if you'd like to preserve your cache, please send your request to our support.
