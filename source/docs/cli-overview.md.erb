The Semaphore Command Line Interface (CLI), is a tool for creating and managing
Semaphore projects from the command line / shell of various operating systems.
It is built with Ruby and the code is [open sourced](https://github.com/renderedtext/cli).

If you have any problems or feature requests please 
[open an issue in the CLI repository on GitHub](https://github.com/renderedtext/cli/issues).

### Prerequisites and installation

The Semaphore CLI requires Ruby >= 2.0 to run to run on your system. Before
installation, verify that you have an up to date Ruby on your system.

The Semaphore CLI is installed as a gem. Run the following command:

``` bash
$ gem install sem
```

Verify that the installation succeded:

### Authentication

To manage resources on Sempahore, you need to log in to Semaphore from the
command line:

### Troubleshooting

The Semaphore CLI can display all the API requests that can help with identifying
issues. This mode is called _trace_ mode.

To run the CLI in trace mode, pass the `--trace` flag to the CLI:

``` bash
$ sem orgs:list --trace
