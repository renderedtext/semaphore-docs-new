### Parallelizing RSpec tests with Boosters

To set up RSpec Boosters, go to your project page. Below the list of branches,
you will find the Go to Boosters button.

When you click on that button, you will land on the Insights page. Scroll to
Build time improvements and select RSpec Booster. Next, pick a branch, and start
a test build. Once we start the build, everything will be sandboxed to this
branch, so your project configuration will not be affected.

In this test build, Semaphore split your test suite across 32 jobs to get the
results as quickly as possible.

Once the build is finished, Semaphore will recommend the optimal number of jobs
required to make your build as fast as possible. Select the number of jobs that
works best for you, and click on Append parallel jobs.

Boosters will now automatically parallelize your RSpec test suite for each new
build.

### Parallelizing Cucumber tests with Boosters

To set up Cucumber Boosters, go to your project page. Below the list of branches,
you will find the Go to Boosters button.

When you click on that button, you will land on the Insights page. Scroll to
Build time improvements and select Cucumber Booster. Next, pick a branch, and
start a test build. Once we start the build, everything will be sandboxed to
this branch, so your project configuration will not be affected.

In this test build, Semaphore split your test suite across 32 jobs to get the
results as quickly as possible.

Once the build is finished, Semaphore will recommend the optimal number of jobs
required to make your build as fast as possible. Select the number of jobs that
works best for you, and click on Append parallel jobs.

Boosters will now automatically parallelize your Cucumber test suite for each
new build.

### Changing Boosters parallelism throughput

To edit your Boosters, go to your project page. Below the list of branches,
you will find the Go to Boosters button. On this page, find the Booster you want
to adjust, and click edit.

A slider will appear that allows you to adjust the number of parallel jobs.

Under the slider, you will notice Semaphore's recommendations for your Best Buy
option, and for the option that will bring the best performance to your test
suite.

After editing the boosters, click Save Changes. The new configuration will take
effect in your new builds.

### Disabling Boosters

To remove a Booster from your project, go to your project page. Below the list
of branches, you will find the Go to Boosters button. On this page, find the
Booster you want to remove from your project.

Click on Remove to delete the Booster configuration. New builds on your project
won't be boosted anymore.
