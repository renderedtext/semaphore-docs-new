Setting up a Golang project on Semaphore is easy. The first time you add a Go
project, Semaphore will analyze it and propose some frequently used build
commands to speed up the setup process. If needed, these commands can be
[customized](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html) to better suit your needs.

## CI environment for Go projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports the following Go versions:

<% package_versions("go").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Switching between different Go versions can be done in Project Settings or by
adding the following command to your build commands:

`change-go-version <version>`

Valid values for `<version>` are `1.4`, `1.5`, `1.6`, `1.7`, `1.8`, `1.9` and `1.10`.

To use `change-go-version` in a bash script, use the following command to load
it:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

source /opt/change-go-version.sh
```

The `$GOPATH` environment variable is set to `/home/runner/workspace` which
contains the `bin`, `pkg` and `src` folders.

Your project's root directory is represented with a symlink in the `src` folder
of `$GOPATH`.

## Dependency management

Go project by default are configured to run:

```
go get -v -d ./… && go build -v ./…
```

The three dots (`...`) Go wildcard is used to expand to all package directories
found in `$GOPATH`.

To achieve faster build times, we recommend caching your project's dependencies
with [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep#install).
