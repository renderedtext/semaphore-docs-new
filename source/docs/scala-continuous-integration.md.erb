Semaphore makes it easy to set up continuous integration for Scala projects.
Both [Java](/docs/java-continuous-integration.html) and Scala runtimes are
preinstalled in the build environment. When you create a project with a Scala
repository, Semaphore will analyze it and suggest to run the tests with the
current Scala version and `sbt`.

After the analysis determines that the project is written in Scala, the
following command will be suggested.

```bash
sbt ++$SEMAPHORE_SCALA_VERSION test
```

You can easily [change or add more build
commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html), customize your build
environment with [custom configuration
files](/docs/adding-custom-configuration-files.html), [environment
variables](/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html) and more (see the
[Customizing your build](/docs/customizing-your-build.html) section for more
information).

## CI environment for Scala projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports Scala version
<%= package_version("scala") %>. Version <%= package_version("sbt") %> of the
[sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) build tool is pre-installed. The current
version of Scala is also avaliable through the `SEMAPHORE_SCALA_VERSION`
environment variable.

## Dependency management

Cached resolution is available in `sbt` as an [experimental feature]
(http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Cached-Resolution.html#Cached+resolution)
starting from version `0.13.7`. If you use this feature, the contents of
`~/.sbt/0.13/dependency/` is [cached between
builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) on Semaphore.

[Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) dependencies are also cached, which
significantly reduces the build time.
