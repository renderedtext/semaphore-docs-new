With Semaphore it's very easy to set up continuous deployment of applications
hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). You only need to make sure that you
have a configured application on Heroku and a corresponding project on
Semaphore.

To get started, find your desired project and follow "Set Up Deployment" link
under branches list.

This will launch a simple 5-step process.

## Choosing your deployment method

The first step is to select Heroku as your deployment method.

## Choosing your deployment strategy

There are two deployment strategies on Semaphore: "automatic" and "manual".

**Automatic** means that a deploy will be triggered after every passed build on
the selected branch. Besides that, you can also manually deploy any build from
any branch at any time.

**Manual** strategy requires manual selection of builds to deploy.

For automatic deployment you will be asked to select which branch will be
automatically deployed after each passed build.

**Note**: You can easily change the deployment strategy from server settings at
any time after the setup is complete.

## Providing Heroku API token

At this point you need to paste your Heroku API token. You can find it under
[account information](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) on the Heroku
dashboard.

By providing your Heroku API token, you authorize Semaphore to configure and set
SSH keys that are needed for deployment.

## Choosing the target Heroku application

After you select your application from the list, Semaphore will generate and set
new pair of SSH keys for you:

- Private key will be encrypted and stored on Semaphore; it will be available to
you in deployment environment.
- Public key will be added to your application's deploy keys on Heroku.

This means that Semaphore will set up everything that you need for deployment on
Heroku, including [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) which allows
you to run any Heroku command during deployment.

## Naming your server on Semaphore

<img src="/docs/assets/img/deploying-to-heroku/server-name.png" class="img-responsive">

In this step you need to provide a name for your server, which can be any name
you like. It will be used on your Semaphore dashboard and deployment timeline.

Each server has its own _alias_ which represents server's name in a safe string
form. The alias is also available in the deploy environment via
`SEMAPHORE_SERVER_NAME` environment variable.

By now the setup is complete - you are ready to automatically deploy to Heroku.

## Additional commands

If your application requires some additional deploy commands (such as running
    migrations after deploy) you can edit the default commands on the summary
page or in project settings under "Deployment" tab.

**Note:** Heroku toolbelt doesn't propagate [exit status
code](/docs/failed-heroku-db-migration-reported-as-passed.html) by default, which leads to
reporting a deploy with a failed Heroku toolbelt command as passed.
