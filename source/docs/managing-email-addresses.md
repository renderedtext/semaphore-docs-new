You're able to add multiple email addresses to your Semaphore account. This
can be done from your Account Settings page.

Each new email address you add needs to be verified. Once you do that, it
can be used as an option in project's notification settings. Email addresses are
globally unique on Semaphore, so two users cannot add (and verify) the same
address.

### Why should you add multiple emails

If a user is subscribed to [personal work notifications](/docs/subscribe-to-your-work.html)
Semaphore will use his verified email addresses to match git commits
with his Semaphore account.

### Primary email

The "Primary email address" is the one you are using to sign in on Semaphore. It
is also the default address for email notifications on all new projects.

There can be only one "Primary email address" per account. You have the option to
change it by clicking on "set as primary" button on the right side of your verified
additional email address. Email address cannot be deleted while it is used
as primary.
