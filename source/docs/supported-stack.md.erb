category: The Semaphore platform

Every build and deploy on Semaphore runs in a lightweight, isolated virtual machine based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit. This page describes the software provided in these VMs.

The timezone in the virtual machine is set to UTC.

### Language support

Semaphore provides first-class support for the following programming languages:

- [Clojure](/docs/clojure-continuous-integration.html)
- [Elixir](/docs/elixir-continuous-integration.html)
- [Go](/docs/go-continuous-integration.html)
- [JavaScript](/docs/javascript-continuous-integration.html), via Node.js
- [PHP](/docs/php-continuous-integration.html)
- [Python](/docs/python-continuous-integration.html)
- [Ruby](/docs/ruby-continuous-integration.html)
- [Scala](/docs/scala-continuous-integration.html)

Runtimes for the following languages are also available: C/C++, Java, Perl and Python.
For them the application has to be configured manually in [project settings](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html).
If you would like another language to be included out of the box, please [send us email](mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com) or [install it manually](/docs/how-to-install-dependency.html).

__Note:__ this is a partial list. You can upgrade or add additional packages for your builds with [apt-get](/docs/how-to-install-dependency.html) - either from Ubuntu's [official distribution channels](http://packages.ubuntu.com) or third-party PPAs.

We have a number of open source [test apps](/docs/test-apps.html) in various flavors that we use for verification. If your setup is different or you're having problems making your build pass, we encourage you to [contact us](mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com) - we'd be happy to get your app building on Semaphore as quickly as possible.
