Creating [an organization](/docs/organizations/about-organizations.html) is
very quick and easy to do. Doing it is part of the workflow of
[setting up a private project to Semaphore](/docs/adding-github-bitbucket-project-to-semaphore.html).

You can also create additional organizations from the "Create new" menu in top
navigation inside the application. Here's how:

1. In the navigation click "Create new" and choose "Organization"
   <img src="/docs/assets/img/setting-up-an-organization/create-organization-navigation-link.png" alt="Create Organization link" class="img-responsive img-bordered">

2. Enter a name for your organization. While you type, Semaphore will check if
   the name is available.

3. That's it, you're done.

If this is your first organization, this will start a **free 30-day trial**
in which you can run up to **8 parallel jobs**. After the free trial expires,
your account will automatically be switched to a free plan, which allows
unlimited jobs for open source projects and up to 100 jobs per month for private
projects. For unlimited private jobs, you can upgrade to our one of the
[paid plans](/pricing).

Note that you can create as many organizations for open source projects as you
like.
