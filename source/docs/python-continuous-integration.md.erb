Semaphore makes it easy to setup continuous integration for Python projects.
When you add a project from a Python repository, Semaphore will run a brief
analysis and suggest some common commands based on the structure of your repository.

For example, after the analysis determines that the project is written in Python
and it has a `requirements.txt` file, the following commands will be suggested:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py test
```

You can easily [change or add more build commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html),
customize your build environment with [custom configuration files](/docs/adding-custom-configuration-files.html),
[environment variables](/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html) and more
(see the [Customizing your build](/docs/customizing-your-build.html) section for more
information).

## CI environment for Python projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports a wide range of
Python versions:

<% package_versions("python").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Python environments are managed with `virtualenv` version <%= package_version("virtualenv") %>. Selecting a Python version in
`Project Settings` activates the corresponding Python environment in your build.
Virtual environments are created in the following path:
`/home/runner/.pyenv/<version>`.

Pre-installed packages include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [mock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock),
[pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/),
and [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Dependency management

Python packages installed with `pip` are [cached between builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html)
on Semaphore. By default, `pip` packages are downloaded to `/home/runner/.pip_download_cache`.
