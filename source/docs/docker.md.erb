Semaphore fully supports using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) in a
continuous delivery process. Docker's container technology can be used in
various use cases. You can learn more about these use cases in the official
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com).

To start using Docker tools, switch your Semaphore project to using the Docker
platform under `Project Settings > Platform`.

Semaphore's Docker platform has Docker <%= package_version("docker") %>, [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)
 <%= package_version("docker-machine") %>, and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) <%= package_version("docker-compose") %> pre-installed, so
you'll be ready to use the Docker [CLI](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)
once you've made the switch in your build commands.

To avoid including the project's [dependency cache](/docs/caching-between-builds.html)
in Docker's build context, add `.semaphore-cache` to the
[dockerignore file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
in your repository.

Docker images can be cached using the included `docker-cache` tool. Add
`docker-cache restore` to your project's [setup commands](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/customizing-build-commands.html)
to load the cached images. Images can be saved by adding `docker-cache snapshot`
as a [after job](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/using-post-thread-commands.html)
command.

If you need to use `docker-cache` tool in a bash script, add the following command in order to enable it:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

source /opt/docker-cache.sh
```
