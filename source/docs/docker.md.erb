Semaphore [fully supports continuous integration and deployment with Docker](https://semaphoreci.com/product/docker).
[Docker's container technology](https://www.docker.com/) can be used in various
use cases. You can learn more about these use cases in the official
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com).

To start using Docker tools, switch your Semaphore project to using the Docker
platform under `Project Settings > Platform`.

Semaphore's Docker platform has Docker <%= package_version("docker") %>, [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)
 <%= package_version("docker-machine") %>, and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) <%= package_version("docker-compose") %> pre-installed, so
you'll be ready to use the Docker [CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/)
once you've made the switch in your build commands.

To avoid including the project's [dependency cache](/docs/caching-between-builds.html)
in Docker's build context, add `.semaphore-cache` to the
[dockerignore file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
in your repository.
