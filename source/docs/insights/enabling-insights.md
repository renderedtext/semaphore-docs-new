If you want Semaphore to show Insights on your project, you will need to
start by enabling this add-on.

To enable Insights for your project, follow the **Add-ons** link on the project
page.

Next, click on **Insights**.

You will see a list of currently supported frameworks.

list" class="img-responsive img-bordered">

Enable Insights for the frameworks used in your project. For example, if you're
using _RSpec_ and _Cucumber_, and you want Insights for both frameworks, you'll
need to enable them for each framework.

## Enabling Insights for a test framework
After you have chosen the desired framework, the next step is to click
**Enable**.

Insights" class="img-responsive img-bordered">

After that, each time you run a build, Semaphore will gather info on build
running time for that project. You can click **Start build** right away, and it
will build your project's latest code revision. You need at least one
successful build after clicking the **Enable** button in order to be able to
get a report on your test files.
