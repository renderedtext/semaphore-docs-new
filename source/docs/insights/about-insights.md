Insights is a Semaphore add-on which provides a report on your slowest test
files. Its goal is to give you useful feedback on your continuous
integration process.

With Insights, you can find out which files are the slowest and which ones
fail most often, and then use this data to enhance your test suite.

To get started with Insights, you need to enable them for the test frameworks
you use in your project.
