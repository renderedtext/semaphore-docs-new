[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) doesn't provide a command to create a "database".

Actually, you don’t need to create it manually, because, MongoDB will create it
on the fly, during the first time you save the value into the defined collection
(or table in SQL), and database.

If your project requires multiple databases you can read more about [using
Postgres, MongoDB and
Redis](docs/how-to-use-postgres-mongodb-and-redis-on-one-project.html) on one project.

List of all packages and versions is available on the [supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
