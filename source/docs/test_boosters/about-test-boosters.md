Test Boosters is a Semaphore add-on which evenly distributes your test files in
parallel threads in order to optimize your build running time.

It works by using the information on your project's build duration gathered by
Insights, so if you want to use Test Boosters, make sure you have [Insights
enabled](/docs/insights/enabling-insights.html).

Semaphore will suggest you an optimal number of threads for your project, but
you are free to choose the number of threads within your current subscription
plan or upgrade.
