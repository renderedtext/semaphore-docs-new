## Overview

The Ubuntu 18.04 platform is based on [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes) and optimized for CI/CD. It comes with a set of preinstalled languages, databases, and utility tools commonly used for CI/CD workflows.

The user in the environment, named `runner`, has full `sudo` access.

The Ubuntu 18.04 platform uses an APT mirror that is in the same data center as Semaphore's build cluster, which means that caching packages will have little effect.

## Why upgrade

- **Ubuntu 14.04 is deprecated** - It means that no new updates are being officaly released and that most package mainteners are no longer shipping new versions. OpenSSL and other core components are outdated and installing newer versions of programming languages is either hard or impossible.
- **Ubuntu 18.04 brings new software** - New release comes with latest software from Linux kernel and system libraties to snapd package management.
- **New versions of programming languages** - New platform release brings newest versions every supported languages.
- **New versions of database** - More databases and multiple versions of databases are now available.
- **Rolling release process** - With new version of the platform we are intorducing new non-disruptive bi-weekly platform update strategy.
- **Better resource management** - We are no longer running all databases by default which frees resources for your workloads. Also some legacy software has been removed freeing a couple more Gb of disk space.

## How to upgrade

### 1. Switch to the new version of the platform

- Visit **Project settings**.
- Click on **Platform** tab in Project settings.
- Select **Ubuntu 18.04 - Rolling relase** platform.
- Click **Save** button located at the bottom of the page.

### 2. Select programming language version with sem-version CLI

Versions are now configured with a built-in `sem-version` command. This new approach enables you to configure versions of different languages and it also enables us to add new versions faster.  

With `sem-version` you can configure versions of the following programming languages: PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Go, Java, C/C++, Python, Elixir, Scala, Node.js. For information about available versions, [check documentation](#supported-software-stack).  

Example of commands that you can add to your job, or to Setup commands that will be executed as a part of every job:
```bash
sem-version ruby 2.6.3
sem-version node 10.1
```

For more information about using sem-version, [check documentation](#sem-version).

### 3. Start databases with sem-service CLI

Start only services that you need with the built-in `sem-service` command. Databases are no longer running by default so you can use the desired versions and more resources are left for running your workloads.  

With `sem-service` you can start the desired version of the following databases and services: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, memcached, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ.  

Example of commands that you can add to your job, or to Setup commands that will be executed before every job:

```bash
sem-service start mysql
sem-service start rabbitmq
sem-service start postgres 11
```

For the list of all databases, services and available versions, check the [Ubuntu 18.04 platform documentation](#supported-software-stack).

### 4. Install additional software

If your application requires software packages that are not pre-installed, be aware that versions available in Ubuntu 18.04 might differ. The best way to go about this is to check the [list of pre-installed packages](#supported-software-stack) before installing software manually.

Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 18.04 have mostly the same components with newer versions. 

Notable changes:  
- Background services are now managed with **systemd**, while in Ubuntu 14.04 it was managed by **init.d** and **upstart**.
- AppArmor is started by default. It’s likely that this will not affect your application unless you are using KVM or QEMU.

### 5. Finally: Run your jobs as you used to.

## Programming languages

The `sem-version` utility is used for changing the version of a programming language. You can find a list of all available programming languages with available versions [here](#programming-languages).  

The supported programming languages are Elixir, Erlang, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, Scala and Node.js.
The general form of the `sem-version` utility is:

```bash
sem-version [LANGUAGE] [VERSION]
```

where [LANGUAGE] is one of `elixir, erlang, go, java, php, ruby, python, scala` and `node`. The value of the [VERSION] parameter depends on the programming language used.  
Example of the sem-version in your job set up:

```bash
sem-version go 1.9
```

## Databases

The `sem-service` is a utility for starting, stopping and getting the status of background services. Started services will listen on 0.0.0.0 and their default port. The 0.0.0.0 IP address includes all available network interfaces. For MySQL and Postgres it’s also possible to access them via the usual socket. Essentially, you will be using services as if they were natively installed in the Operating System.

The general form of a `sem-service` command is as follows:

```bash
sem-service start [mysql | postgres | postgis | redis | memcached | mongodb | elasticsearch | rabbitmq | rethinkdb | cassandra] [version] [--username=username] [--password=password] [--db=databasename]
```

Therefore, each `sem-service` command requires at least two parameters: the first one is the task you want to perform and the second parameter is the name of the service that will be used for the task. The third parameter is optional and is the version of the service that you want to start.

For MySQL, PostgreSQL and PostGIS it is possible to provide a username via `--username=username`, the password for the new username via `--password=password` and a database name for which the user will be granted admin access via `--db=dbname`.

- The default MySQL username is `root`, the password is `semaphoredb` and the default database name is `test`
- The default PostgreSQL and PostGIS username is `runner` and the password is `semaphoredb`.

If no version value is given, a default value will be used according to the following list:

- mysql: The default value is `5.6`
- postgres: The default value is `9.6`
- postgis: The default value is `9.6-2.5`, meaning postgis 2.5 and postgres 9.6
- redis: The default value is `4`
- memcached: The default value is `1.5`
- mongodb: The default value is `4.1`
- elasticsearch: The default value is `6.5.1`
- rabbitmq: The default is `3.8.2`
- rethinkdb: The default is `2.3.6`
- cassandra: The default is `3.11.3`

`sem-service` uses images from Docker Hub and supports all versions that are available in Docker Hub. You can find the list of available versions at the following URLs:

## Release process

- **Rolling release**: - Ubuntu 18.04 platform will be automatically updated in small increments, meaning that users will always have the latest versions of software.
- **Schedule**: The image will be updated bi-weekly, on the first and third week of every month. Updates may happen sooner if there are any security updates or bug fixes that need to be implemented. For updates please check [changelng](#changelog)
- **No action required**: Since the rolling release process is used to update this image, no action is required on user side. The newest version of software and services will be automatically available to users once the update happenes.
