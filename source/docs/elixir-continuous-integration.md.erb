Semaphore makes it easy to setup continuous integration for Elixir projects.
After a project is added to Semaphore and the analysis determines that it's
written in Elixir, a set of commonly used `mix` commands will be provided to
make the initial setup easier.

```
mix local.hex --force
mix deps.get
mix test
```

You can easily [change or add more build commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html),
customize your build environment with [configuration files]
(/docs/adding-configuration-files.html), [environment variables]
(/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html) and more (see the
'Customizing your build' section for more
information).


## CI environment for Elixir projects

The build environment has Erlang <%= package_version("erlang") %> and the
following Elixir versions pre-installed:

<% package_versions("elixir").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Elixir is part of the `PATH` so no extra configuration is required. This means
that tools like [mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Project.html)
are readily available.

Elixir is managed with [kiex](https://github.com/taylor/kiex) which means that
any version can be [installed](https://github.com/taylor/kiex#usage) with Semaphore
build commands. The commands below install Elixir version `0.15.1` and mark it as
active.

```
kiex install 0.15.1
kiex use 0.15.1
```

## Dependency management

Hex [dependencies](https://hex.pm/docs/usage) are automatically cached between
builds. For caching any other files you can use Semaphore's [cache directory]
(/docs/caching-between-builds.html).
