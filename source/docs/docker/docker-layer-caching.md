## <a name="usage" href="#usage">How to use Docker layer caching</a>

Once you've configured [Semaphore's Docker integration](/docs/docker.html),
you can use the following snippet to build an image using `--cache-from`.
A pre-existing image will be used as the cache source.
The following commands should be part of your [project's build settings](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html):

```bash
export CACHE_IMAGE=aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app

docker pull $CACHE_IMAGE:$BRANCH_NAME || true
docker build --cache-from $CACHE_IMAGE:$BRANCH_NAME --tag $CACHE_IMAGE:$BRANCH_NAME .
docker push $CACHE_IMAGE:$BRANCH_NAME
```

To ensure a good cache hit, you should choose [Semaphore's environment variable](/docs/available-environment-variables.html)
`BRANCH_NAME` as a tag.
This way, each branch will have its own cache to avoid cache collision.

The `CACHE_IMAGE` environment variable specifies the name of the Docker image that is used
as a cache source. This is usually your main application image.

The first command attempts to pull the image from the registry. If this is
the first time building this branch's image, this step will be skipped.

The second command builds a Docker image, and tags it with the branch name.
If the tagged image is available, it is used as a cache source.

The last command pushes the resulting tagged Docker image along with its dependent layers
to your container registry. Once pushed, it becomes available
for reuse as a cache source in consequent builds.
To automate the authentication process for your chosen registry, configure your
project to integrate with [one of the supported
methods](/docs/docker/setting-up-continuous-integration-for-docker-project.html).

After completing these steps, you can tag and push images as you normally would.

## <a name="docker_compose" href="#docker_compose">Layer caching in Docker Compose</a>

You can define one or more images to be used as cache sources using the following clause:

```yaml
version: '3.2'

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      cache_from:
        - ${CACHE_IMAGE}
    volumes:
     - .:/code
```

You can include [`cache_from`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#cache_from)
in the build section of target services [if your Docker Compose version is 1.12.0 or newer](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1120-2017-04-04).

## <a name="how_caching_works" href="#how_caching_works">How Docker caching works</a>

When building an image from a `Dockerfile`, each line generates its own layer. These
layers are [cached](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#build-cache),
and they can be reused if no changes are detected. If a layer changes, all
the following layers have to be created from scratch.

Starting with [Docker 1.13](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1130-2017-01-18),
the `docker build` command introduced a new switch `--cache-from`, which allows us
to specify a tagged image as a cache source. More than one image can be
specified with several `--cache-from` switches. Each gets a tagged image.
The image resulting from the build  can also be used as a cache source in
another Docker build.

As a result of changes in Docker's caching mechanism, our `docker-cache` tool
is deprecated. We recommend using `--cache-from` combined with a Docker container
registry instead.

## <a name="best_practices" href="#best_practices">Best practices</a>

When working with Docker images, it's convenient to `export` the name of the image as
an environmental variable, or define it in your
[project's environment variables](/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html).
This will allow you to write compact Docker commands.

To maximize layer re-use between builds, it's important to structure the
`Dockerfile` so that frequently changing steps (eg. `ADD`ing code) are towards
the end, and less frequently changing steps (eg. `RUN`ing `apt-get install`) are
on top. This will ensure that the steps concerned with doing the same
action are not unnecessarily rebuilt. See our guide for [Lightweight Docker
Images in 5 Steps](/blog/2016/12/13/lightweight-docker-images-in-5-steps.html) for more details.

In order to improve the speed of pushing and pulling images in your Semaphore
builds, the Docker container registry should be geographically as close as
possible to the Semaphore build servers in Germany.
To compare approximately how much time is needed to push or pull a Docker
image, depending on the registry's physical location and the image's size,
see the results of our benchmarks visualized in the following charts:

<img src="/docs/assets/img/docker/docker-layer-caching/registry-push-graph.png" class="img-responsive img-bordered" alt="Time needed to push Docker image to registry">
<img src="/docs/assets/img/docker/docker-layer-caching/registry-pull-graph.png" class="img-responsive img-bordered" alt="Time needed to pull Docker image from registry">

Note that `local` refers to a local Docker container registry, running inside the build
environment. This functionality isn't shipped with the environment, and it serves
only as a base line. To avoid any compression that might occur during the push and
pull operations, image contents are generated using `/dev/urandom`. As such, these
transfer speeds are not likely to occur, and standard images will have considerably
better performance.

If you wish to cache some Docker image layers and thus save time in future builds, you may activate the layer caching by adding the bolded lines to your Docker compose file:

```yaml
version: '3.2'
services:
  web:
  build:
  context: .
  cache_from:
  - ${CACHE_IMAGE}
```

where CACHE_IMAGE is, for example, defined with the following command that should be added to the setup of your project (please update value according to your needs):

```bash
export CACHE_IMAGE=aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app
```







  volumes: - .:/code
     - .:/code
```
